Picross was my first GA project (3 weeks in) and I am ecstatic about how it turned out. Incredibly logic intensive, picross is a pixel puzzle game where users navigate puzzles and use clues on the X and Y axis to determine where the filled in pixels should be.

The reason why I love this game so much is the 3 different game modes I used which each have a different logical algorithm.
1. Story mode - this mode is 5 pre-built puzzles that are meant to be a fun introduction to the game. Each puzzle lights up with colors based on the puzzle afterwards and has the best UX.
2. Random mode - this mode takes a randomly generates binary string up to 25 digits, converts them into pixels on the game board and creates a mathematically random puzzle for the user. This is my favorite game mode and I still play it from time to time.
3. Build mode - this mode is pretty cool. Users are met with an empty game board and can click each cell to toggle them as active/inactive. When the user a desired active puzzle, they can click 'build' and the game will turn it into a solvable puzzle.
