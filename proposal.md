## What is 'picross' ?
http://www.fogames.com/games/picross-madness/#.VrEFhTYrKRs

Picross is a 1-play, grid-based logic game where users strategically 'guess' a block to fill in based on numbers from the axis. The best way to describe the game is a combination of sudoku and minesweeper.

## Proposal

My goal is to cr3eate a browser-functional version of the flash game shown in the link above. Include a home screen, a win state with an animation showing the result, a life count, and a 'pencil' tool.

Depending on how far I get I would want to include different difficulties, and POSSIBLY the option to create your own pixel drawing and use it in the game.
